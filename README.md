LYIT Sem 2 : Technical Assignment on Survival Analysis
Though the disaster at titanic happened hundreds of years ago, researchers are still looking for some explanation as to why some passengers survived and others did not. It was quite difficult to make that conclusion in the early days of the crash, but due to the advancements of technology in the field of analytics and with the help of new data mining techniques, the contributing factors to determine whether a person will survive can be identified with more precision. Analysis in this technical review is done on passengerâ€™s characteristics such as class of cabin, passengers age, departure point, and its relationship with the chance of survival. 

The python notebook in this repo shows the steps taken for data loading, feature engineering, data visualization, and model creation.
